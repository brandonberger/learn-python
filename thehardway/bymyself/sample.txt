First, let's use a migration to define a database 
table to hold all of our tasks. Laravel's database migrations 
provide an easy way to define your database table 
structure and modifications using fluent, expressive PHP code. 
Instead of telling your team members to manually add 
columns to their local copy of the database, your teammates can 
simply run the migrations you push into source control.
